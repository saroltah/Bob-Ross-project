  <div class="fact">Bob Ross kept an alligator in the bathtub as a kid</div>
  <div class="fact">Bob Ross was an air force master sergeant</div>
  <div class="fact">Bob Ross made three copies of each painting you see in the Joy of painting</div>
  <div class="text">A lifelong animal lover, Ross was always rescuing wounded animals and nursing them back to health. As a kid growing up in Florida, this meant one rather strange addition to the family: an alligator, which he attempted to nurse back to health in the Ross family bathtub. Even in his adult life, Ross was always playing host to orphaned and injured animals, including an epileptic squirrel that lived in his empty Jacuzzi.</div>
  <div class="text">Rossâ€™s quiet voice and gentle demeanor were two of his most iconic traits, which makes the fact that he spent 20 years in the United States Air Force and retired with the rank of master sergeant all the more surprising. Basically, he was the guy who told everyone else what to do.</div>
  <div class="text">Ross shot 403 episodes of The Joy of Painting and made three near-exact copies of each painting per episode. The first copy always hid off screen, and Ross referred to it while the cameras rolled (none of his on-air paintings were spontaneous). Ross painted a third copy when filming finished. This time, an assistant would stand behind him and snap photos of each brushstroke; these pictures went into his how-to books.</div>

<div class="title">Wet-on-wet technique</div>
<p>Bob Ross made use of the wet on wet method in oil painting, also referred to as the 'alla prima'. Here, you do not wait for your paints to dry in the interim. As its name implies, you apply paint layers on top of one another, which enables them to mix and blend.</p>
